# Helios for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds language support for the Helios programming language to
VSCode.

Currently, it provides syntax-highlighting support for `.he` files. A language
server for Helios (Helios-LS), included as part of the compiler at the moment,
is under development. You can check it out [here][github:helios-lang].
