# Helios for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds language support for the Helios programming language to
VSCode.

Currently, it provides syntax-highlighting support for `.he` files. A language
server for Helios (HLS), included as part of the compiler, is under development.
You can check it out [here][github:helios-lang].
